## General

An algebra is a set of values, a set of operators that it is closed
under and some laws it must obey.

Each Fantasy Land algebra is a separate specification. An algebra may
have dependencies on other algebras which must be implemented.

## Terminology

1. "value" is any JavaScript value, including any which have the
   structures defined below.
2. "equivalent" is an appropriate definition of equivalence for the given value.
    The definition should ensure that the two values can be safely swapped out in a program that respects abstractions. For example:
    - Two lists are equivalent if they are equivalent at all indices.
    - Two plain old JavaScript objects, interpreted as dictionaries, are equivalent when they are equivalent for all keys.
    - Two promises are equivalent when they yield equivalent values.
    - Two functions are equivalent if they yield equivalent outputs for equivalent inputs.

## Type signature notation

The type signature notation used in this document is described below:<sup
id="sanctuary-types-return">[1](#sanctuary-types)</sup>

* `::` _"is a member of"._
    - `e :: t` can be read as: "the expression `e` is a member of type `t`".
    - `true :: Boolean` - "`true` is a member of type `Boolean`".
    - `42 :: Integer, Number` - "`42` is a member of the `Integer` and
      `Number` types".
* _New types can be created via type constructors._
    - Type constructors can take zero or more type arguments.
    - `Array` is a type constructor which takes one type argument.
    - `Array String` is the type of all arrays of strings. Each of the
      following has type `Array String`: `[]`, `['foo', 'bar', 'baz']`.
    - `Array (Array String)` is the type of all arrays of arrays of strings.
      Each of the following has type `Array (Array String)`: `[]`, `[ [], []
      ]`, `[ [], ['foo'], ['bar', 'baz'] ]`.
* _Lowercase letters stand for type variables._
    - Type variables can take any type unless they have been restricted by
      means of type constraints (see fat arrow below).
* `->` (arrow) _Function type constructor._
    - `->` is an _infix_ type constructor that takes two type arguments where
      left argument is the input type and the right argument is the output type.
    - `->`'s input type can be a grouping of types to create the type of a
      function which accepts zero or more arguments. The syntax is:
      `(<input-types>) -> <output-type>`, where `<input-types>` comprises zero
      or more comma–space (`, `)-separated type representations and parens
      may be omitted for unary functions.
    - `String -> Array String` is a type satisfied by functions which take a
      `String` and return an `Array String`.
    - `String -> Array String -> Array String` is a type satisfied by functions
      which take a `String` and return a function which takes an `Array String`
      and returns an `Array String`.
    - `(String, Array String) -> Array String` is a type satisfied by functions
      which take a `String` and an `Array String` as arguments and return an
      `Array String`.
    - `() -> Number` is a type satisfied by functions
      which do not take arguments and return a `Number`.
* `~>` (squiggly arrow) _Method type constructor._
    - When a function is a property of an Object, it is called a method. All
      methods have an implicit parameter type - the type of which they are a
      property.
    - `a ~> a -> a` is a type satisfied by methods on Objects of type `a` which
      take a type `a` as an argument and return a value of type `a`.
* `=>` (fat arrow) _Expresses constraints on type variables._
    - In `a ~> a -> a` (see squiggly arrow above), `a` can be of any type.
      `Semigroup a => a ~> a -> a` adds a constraint such that the type `a`
      must now satisfy the `Semigroup` typeclass. To satisfy a typeclass means
      to lawfully implement all functions/methods specified by that typeclass.

For example:

```
fantasy-land/traverse :: Applicative f, Traversable t => t a ~> (TypeRep f, a -> f b) -> f (t b)
'-------------------'    '--------------------------'    '-'    '-------------------'    '-----'
 '                        '                               '      '                        '
 '                        ' - type constraints            '      ' - argument types       ' - return type
 '                                                        '
 '- method name                                           ' - method target type
```

## Type representatives

Certain behaviours are defined from the perspective of a member of a type.
Other behaviours do not require a member. Thus certain algebras require a
type to provide a value-level representative (with certain properties). The
Identity type, for example, could provide `Id` as its type representative:
`Id :: TypeRep Identity`.

If a type provides a type representative, each member of the type must have
a `constructor` property which is a reference to the type representative.

    m.constructor['fantasy-land/chainRec'](f, i)

1. `f` must be a function which returns a value
    1. If `f` is not a function, the behaviour of `fantasy-land/chainRec` is unspecified.
    2. `f` takes three arguments `next`, `done`, `value`
        1. `next` is a function which takes one argument of same type as `i` and can return any value
        2. `done` is a function which takes one argument and returns the same type as the return value of `next`
        3. `value` is some value of the same type as `i`
    3. `f` must return a value of the same ChainRec which contains a value returned from either `done` or `next`

## Types

In Fantasy Land, types are specified by a capitalized name and a catamorphic
method of the same name, without capitalization. The method allows access to
the values contained within the structure or the ability to provide a default
value when the structure is nullary. When defined on a value, a method name
contains the same 'fantasy-land/' as other methods described in the spec prefix.

For example
```hs
identity :: Identity i => i a ~> (a -> b) -> b
```

Additionally, data constructors may be referenced in the specification by name
and arity. Conforming data structures are not required to provide these
constructors nor are any provided constructors required to share these names.
Instead of `Just` and `Nothing`, the constructors could be named `Some` and
`None`.

For example
```js
function Some(x) {
  if (!(this instanceof Some)) return new Some(x);
  this.x = x;
};
Some.prototype['fantasy-land/maybe'] = function maybe(_, f) {
  return f(this.x);
};

var None = {
  'fantasy-land/maybe': function maybe(d, _) {
    return d;
  }
};

Array.prototype['fantasy-land/maybe'] = function maybe(d, f) {
  return this.length === 0 ? d : f(this[0]);
};

function maybe(d, f, m) {
  return m['fantasy-land/maybe'](d, f);
}

var head = maybe.bind(null, None, Some);

var none = head([]);
none // None

var some = head([1, 2, 3]);
some // Some(1);

function fromMaybe(d, m) {
  return maybe(d, x => x, m);
}
fromMaybe(0, none) // 0
fromMaybe(0, some) // 1
```

### Maybe

The `Maybe` type encodes the concept of optionality (Nothing and Just a).

#### `maybe` method

```hs
maybe :: Maybe m => m a ~> (b, (a -> b)) -> b
```

A value which conforms to the Maybe specification must provide a `maybe` method.

The `maybe` method takes two arguments:

    m.maybe(x, f)

1. `x` is the default value in the `Nothing` case

    1. If `x` does not match the return value of `maybe`, the behaviour of
       `maybe` is unspecified.

2. `f` must be a unary function. It is called in the `Just` case

    1. If `f` is not a unary function or the return value of `f` does not match
       the return value of `maybe`, the behaviour of `maybe` is unspecified.
 
### Either

The `Either` type encodes the concept of binary possibility (Left a and Right b).

#### `either` method

```hs
either :: Either e => e a b ~> ((a -> c), (b -> c)) -> c
```

A value which conforms to the Either specification must provide an `either` method.

The `either` method takes two arguments:

    e.either(f, g)

1. `f` must be a unary function. It is called in the `Left` case

    1. If `f` is not a unary function or the return value of `f` does not match
       the return value of `either`, the behaviour of `either` is unspecified.

2. `g` must be a unary function. It is called in the `Right` case

    1. If `g` is not a unary function or the return value of `g` does not match
       the return value of `either`, the behaviour of `either` is unspecified.

### Pair

`Pair` is the canonical product type and represents a structure containing two
values (Pair a b).

```hs
pair :: Pair p => p a b ~> ((a, b) -> c) -> c
```

A value which conforms to the Pair specification must provide a `pair` method.

The `pair` method takes a single argument:

    p.pair(f)

1. `f` must be a binary function

    1. If `f` is not a binary function or the return value of `f` does not match
       the return value of `pair`, the behaviour of `pair` is unspecified.

## Derivations

When creating data types which satisfy multiple algebras, authors may choose
to implement certain methods then derive the remaining methods. Derivations:

  - [`fantasy-land/equals`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/lte`][]:

    ```js
    function equals(other) { return this['fantasy-land/lte'](other) && other['fantasy-land/lte'](this); }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/map`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/ap`][] and [`fantasy-land/of`][]:

    ```js
    function map(f) { return this['fantasy-land/ap'](this.constructor['fantasy-land/of'](f)); }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/map`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/chain`][] and [`fantasy-land/of`][]:

    ```js
    function map(f) { return this['fantasy-land/chain'](a => this.constructor['fantasy-land/of'](f(a))); }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/map`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/bimap`][]:

    ```js
    function map(f) { return this['fantasy-land/bimap'](a => a, f); }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/map`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/promap`][]:

    ```js
    function map(f) { return this['fantasy-land/promap'](a => a, f); }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/ap`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/chain`][]:

    ```js
    function ap(m) { return m['fantasy-land/chain'](f => this['fantasy-land/map'](f)); }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/reduce`][] may be derived as follows:

    ```js
    function reduce(f, acc) {
      function Const(value) {
        this.value = value;
      }
      Const['fantasy-land/of'] = function(_) {
        return new Const(acc);
      };
      Const.prototype['fantasy-land/map'] = function(_) {
        return this;
      };
      Const.prototype['fantasy-land/ap'] = function(b) {
        return new Const(f(b.value, this.value));
      };
      return this['fantasy-land/traverse'](x => new Const(x), Const['fantasy-land/of']).value;
    }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/map`][] may be derived as follows:

    ```js
    function map(f) {
      function Id(value) {
        this.value = value;
      }
      Id['fantasy-land/of'] = function(x) {
        return new Id(x);
      };
      Id.prototype['fantasy-land/map'] = function(f) {
        return new Id(f(this.value));
      };
      Id.prototype['fantasy-land/ap'] = function(b) {
        return new Id(this.value(b.value));
      };
      return this['fantasy-land/traverse'](x => Id['fantasy-land/of'](f(x)), Id['fantasy-land/of']).value;
    }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/filter`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/of`][], [`fantasy-land/chain`][], and [`fantasy-land/zero`][]:

    ```js
    function filter(pred) {
      var F = this.constructor;
      return this['fantasy-land/chain'](x => pred(x) ? F['fantasy-land/of'](x) : F['fantasy-land/zero']());
    }
    ```

  - [`fantasy-land/filter`][] may be derived from [`fantasy-land/concat`][], [`fantasy-land/of`][], [`fantasy-land/zero`][], and
    [`fantasy-land/reduce`][]:

    ```js
    function filter(pred) {
      var F = this.constructor;
      return this['fantasy-land/reduce']((f, x) => pred(x) ? f['fantasy-land/concat'](F['fantasy-land/of'](x)) : f, F['fantasy-land/zero']());
    }
    ```

If a data type provides a method which *could* be derived, its behaviour must
be equivalent to that of the derivation (or derivations).

## Notes

1. If there's more than a single way to implement the methods and
   laws, the implementation should choose one and provide wrappers for
   other uses.
2. It's discouraged to overload the specified methods. It can easily
   result in broken and buggy behaviour.
3. It is recommended to throw an exception on unspecified behaviour.
4. An `Identity` container which implements many of the methods is provided by
   [sanctuary-identity](https://github.com/sanctuary-js/sanctuary-identity).

There also exists [Static Land Specification](https://github.com/rpominov/static-land)
with exactly the same ideas as Fantasy Land but based on static methods instead of instance methods.
