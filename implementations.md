# Conformant Implementations

Here are a list of implementations that live in Fantasy Land:

* [Most.js](https://github.com/cujojs/most) implements Monoid, Functor, Applicative, and Monad for streams
* [creed](https://github.com/briancavalier/creed) implements Monoid, Functor, Applicative, and Monad for promises, and interops with Promises/A+ and ES2015 Promise
* [bacon.js](https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js) implements
  Monad and Functor for EventStream and Property on the "fantasy-land" branch

  structures that implement Monad
* [sweet-fantasies](https://github.com/pufuwozu/sweet-fantasies) provides
  macros for syntactic sugar of Semigroup and Monad

  provides common functions that work for Fantasy Land structures
* ECMAScript 5 provides a Semigroup and Functor for Array
* [lz](https://github.com/goatslacker/lz) implements Semigroup, Monoid, Functor, and Monad for lazy Array and String
* [Pacta](https://github.com/mudge/pacta) is an algebraic implementation of
  Promises that implements Semigroup, Monoid, Functor, Applicative, Chain and
  Monad
* [Pirandello](https://github.com/quarterto/Pirandello) better streams, with a MonadPlus
* [Parsimmon](https://github.com/jayferd/parsimmon) implements parsers that are semigroups, applicative functors, and monads.
* [Bennu](https://github.com/mattbierner/bennu/) parsec style parser combinators implement monad, monoid, functor, and applicative functor.
